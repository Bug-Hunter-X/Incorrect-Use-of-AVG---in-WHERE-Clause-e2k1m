This repository demonstrates a common error in SQL queries: using aggregate functions like AVG() incorrectly within the WHERE clause. The provided code attempts to filter employees based on whether their salary exceeds the average.  However, this approach leads to an error because the WHERE clause processes rows individually before the aggregate function is applied. The solution demonstrates how to achieve the correct filtering using a subquery.
